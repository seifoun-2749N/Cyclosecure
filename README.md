  - Validates crash events through user input to reduce false positives.
  
- **Real-Time Location Sharing:**
  - Sends the cyclist's current GPS coordinates upon confirmed impact.

- **Emergency Alerts:**
  - Automatically sends SMS messages to pre-configured emergency contacts.
  - Places automated phone calls to contacts in critical scenarios.

- **Firebase Integration:**
  - Logs GPS data, sensor readings, and crash events to the cloud.
  - Allows remote access to real-time and historical data.

- **User Configuration via Bluetooth:**
  - Configure user email, emergency contacts, and messages from a mobile app or PC over Bluetooth.

- **Device Management Interface:**
  - Users can view live data and manage settings from a connected mobile device or web platform via Firebase.

- **WiFi + GSM Dual Communication:**
  - Uses WiFi for cloud synchronization and GSM for SMS/calls when offline.
